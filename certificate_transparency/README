The trusted CT logs are listed in log_list.json. That list is converted to a plist used by trustd by BuildTrustedCTLogsPlist.rb.

Each log is listed in the "logs" array as a dictionary. Each log must have the following keys to support building the plist:
   -"state", the value of which is 0, 1, 2, or 3, for included logs, frozen (by the operator) logs, logs pending inclusion, and logs that we have disqualified, respectively.
   -"key", the value of which is a Base64-encoded Subject Public Key Info
   -"operated_by", the value of which is an array containing the operator id from the "operators" array
If the log is frozen, the entry in the log dictionary must also contain the "final_sth" key, the value of which is a dictionary. That dictionary must contain the "timestamp" key with the current NTP Time [RFC5905], measured since the epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00), ignoring leap seconds, in milliseconds. This dictionary should also contain the final tree size and the final tree head siganture.
If the log is disqualified, the entry in the log dictionary must also contain the "disqualified_at" key containing the current NTP Time [RFC5905], measured since the epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00), ignoring leap seconds, in milliseconds.

If a log is added from a new operator, the new operator should be added to the "operators" array.
